// Frame step in whole vsyncs (pure function, shared by Mac / iOS; unit test tests/t_fstep.c). The rewriter's frame-step stubs (patch_nso.py FRAME_STEP: Tears of the Kingdom 1.4.3,
// Breath of the Wild 1.9.0) step the game by the vsyncs (1/60 s) the host hands them each frame, and the host keeps each frame on screen for k vsyncs (hle_nvn.c present_itv).
// At a steady rate the step is the time on screen: even motion, and only steps the games' own interval logic uses (60 / 30 / 20 fps). Real time the game falls behind (a late
// frame, a hitch) is a debt paid back one extra vsync per frame, so over time game time = real time. k follows the frames' cost: three late frames in a row step up to the cost
// (30 fps when 60 does not hold: no 40 fps steps on 120 Hz screens); 30 frames in a row whose cost would fit k − 1 try it, and a trial that fails waits twice as long before
// the next (1 s → 8 s), so a device on the edge does not flap.
// A probe is a trial back to kmin that the cost does not justify: while the caller reports the CPU slowed for reasons other than heat (an iPhone's performance controller
// parks a game that waits out a long hold on the efficiency cores at half the clock, where its cost never fits k − 1 again), the hold-off alone starts one. Its first
// FSTEP_GRACE frames may be late without failing it, the time the controller needs to raise the clock for the shorter deadline; after them it is judged like a trial.
// A probe that holds leaves the hold-off as it is, and the run at kmin it starts must last FSTEP_HOLD_MAX (8 s) before the hold-off returns to 1 s: a shorter one counts as
// a failed probe, so a CPU that really cannot hold kmin is not probed every second.
// A step up after a run at kmin of FSTEP_HOLD_MAX keeps the cost that held there, and a cost at the longer hold of at most FSTEP_SAME times it starts a probe too: the scene
// costs what it did, so the step up came from a hitch (Breath of the Wild on an iPhone: pipeline compiles after a cutscene). The fit trial alone does not bring such a game
// back: an iPhone lowers its GPU clock until the work fills most of the frame, so a GPU-bound game's cost sits near FSTEP_FIT at either hold (BotW: GPU 12.8–15.2 ms at hold
// 2, p50, where hold 1 had held for minutes; the same 4,900 draws took 5.8 ms after a trip to the background and 13.5 ms half a minute later).
// A cap that falls and rises again (a movie, hle_movie.c dm_movie_playing; the iOS thermal cap in hle_nvn.c) keeps what was learned at each kmin: the cost that held it
// (cref) and the GPU reference (nvn_fgpu below); and the frames after the cap rises are a probe with its grace, as the clocks are still set for the longer hold. Before, the
// rise set k to kmin with no grace, so three frames late while the clock rose stepped up again, with cref dropped at the cap change and a GPU reference taken at the 30 fps
// cap: neither the fit trial (a GPU-bound cost near FSTEP_FIT) nor a probe brought kmin back (t_fstep: the movie and thermal cap cases). A cref kept from before the cap
// starts a probe only when the cost at the longer hold is within FSTEP_SAME of it, and a failed probe doubles the hold-off as any other does.
// A hold above kmin that the frames held, on time, for FSTEP_RUN frames keeps their cost (kheld): from a longer hold, a trial back to it starts after the hold-off when that
// cost fits it, whatever the cost at the longer hold is, with a probe's grace for the clock to rise. A GPU's clock falls until the work fills the longer hold: Ocarina of Time on
// the Odin 3 took 20-22 ms a frame at hold 2, then 26-31 ms at hold 3 after one heavy moment stepped it there, a cost at FSTEP_FIT of hold 2 that never made the fit trial's run of
// 30, so it stayed at 20 fps (the probe goes to kmin, 60 fps, which does not hold there). Three such trials failing in a row forget the cost until the frames hold that hold again

// The GPU clock follows the hold too: Breath of the Wild on an iPhone went from 14.4 to about 25 ms of GPU time a frame at hold 2 with the same 4,900 draws, the CPU still on its
// performance cores, so its cost never fitted hold 1 again. The GPU counts as slowed (another reason for nvn_fstep_next's slow) when its time at a hold above kmin is at least
// FSTEP_GPU_SLOW times its time at kmin and it alone does not fit k − 1 (a GPU at 3 ms of 17, 6 times its time on a loading screen, is not what holds a frame back).
// The reference is not updated during a probe's grace (its frames run while the clock is still rising). The probe's frames after the grace ran at kmin with the clock up:
// they move the reference half-way each, so a scene that is heavy at every hold stops calling the GPU slowed after a failed probe. Tears of the Kingdom on the Y700 kept a
// reference from its title screen (0.1 vsyncs), so its open world (GPU 1.4-1.9 vsyncs at every hold) was "15 times slower" for good: 27 probes in 66 s, each a burst of
// late frames that sent the hold to 3 (20 fps), and every trial back from 3 to 2 that held set the hold-off back to 1 s. It is kept for each kmin: one
// learned at a 30 fps cap is the GPU time at the clock that cap left (lowered for 30 fps, and under the thermal cap for the heat), and taken as hold 1's after the cap rose it
// made the same work at hold 2 look not slowed.
// A reference that does not fit kmin itself (a mean above kmin: the GPU's time at kmin, at the clock kmin raised, is more than the hold, which no pacing sustains) rules the probe out:
// whatever the longer hold added, kmin was not held without it. Ocarina of Time on the Odin 3 (GPU clock at its maximum at every hold) costs 1.2-2.1 vsyncs of GPU time
// in Kokiri Forest by where the camera looks; a failed probe left a reference of 1.3, the heavy views were 1.5 times it, and each turn of the camera started another
// probe: 60-90 late frames at hold 1, then hold 3 (4 probes in 17 s, 358 late frames of 900; t_fstep: the view case)
